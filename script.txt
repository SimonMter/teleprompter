[Introduction]
Hello!
Im going to be talking about the book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. Its a dystopian novel that describes a future, where books are banned. In the world, Firefighters nolonger put out fires but instead they start them, to burn books. The story follows a man called Guy Montag, who is a firefighter that starts questioning why books are burnt.

[Author Background]
Okay, so before we get into the story, I want to give a little background about the author.
Ray Bradbury wrote this book in 1953, during the early days of the Cold War. At the time, there was a lot of fear about censorship. Bradbury was worried about people blindly accepting ideas without thinking for themselves.
He was also concerned about the rise of mass media, like TV, which he thought could distract people from reading and thinking critically themselves.
So he wrote Fahrenheit 451 to warn readers about what could happen if society stopped to think independently

[Summary]
Here's the story in more detail:
Guy Montag is a firefighter in a world where books are banned.
In the begining of the book, he loves his job and enjoys burning books, he says that it brings him a strange sense of pleasure.
But things start to change, when one day he meets the 17 year old Clarisse McClellan, who sees the world differently. She asks question that make Montag realize how empty his life has become.

[Summary 2]
Montag also notices that his wife, Mildred, is obsessed with the so called TV walls in their home, 
she's completely disconnected from reality, and it shows him how people in his society are addicted to fast, shallow media.

[Summary 3]
After a series of events. Montag secretly takes books from people's houses and starts reading them himself.
Montag's boss, Captain Beatty somehow catches fire and tries to convince him that books are dangerous and that society is better off without them, but Montag keeps thinking for himself.

[Summary 4]
Eventually, Montag's rebellion leads to him having to burn down his own house and flee from the authorities. The book ends with Montag escaping and finding a group of people who memorized books to preserve knowledge

[Character & Conflict]
The main Characters are:
Guy Montag - the firefighter that rebells and wants to fix theproblems of society
Mildred Montag - his wife, shes obsessed with the TV walls and entertainment
Clarisse McClellan - a curious young women, that kind of wakes up Montag
Captain Beatty - Montag's boss, who defends the burning of books

[Themes, symbols & messages]
The main theme in Fahrenheit 451 is censorship.
The government bans books to control what people think, keeping them from learning or questioning authority.
For example, Montag's job as a firefighter is literally to destroy knowledge by burning books.

Another theme is addiction to shallow media and distraction
People in the books are obsessed with TV walls, loud radio, and quick entertainment, which prevents them from thinking deeply. We can draw a connection to social media today, like the endless scrolling on TikTok or spending your time watching Youtube videos.

The book features some symbols, the most important symbols in the novel are:
- Fahrenheit 451, the title itselve is a symbol. At 451 degrees Fahrenheit, book paper catches fire and burns.
- fire: It represnts destruction, because it burns the books
- The Phoenix - During the story, the mystical bird is mentioned, the pheonix is a bird, which burns and is reborn from its own ashes. This symbolizes renewal and survivol of knowledge.
- Books themselves are a symbol aswell. They symbolize knowledge, ideas and independence.

The message of the novel is that knowledge is essential for freedom and humanity. Censorship, mindless entertainment and blind conformity can destroy society,s ability to think and grow. This message is still relevant today, because even in free societies, people can be too distracted to obtain knowledge.

[Reading]
Now I’m going to read a short excerpt from the beginning of the novel, from pages 5 to 6.
... page 5-6 ...
I chose this passage because it introduces both the world of Fahrenheit 451 and Guy Montag’s mindset at the start of the story.
In this scene, Montag describes how much he enjoys burning books and how normal this feels to him.
It shows that he fully accepts the rules of his society and doesn’t question them yet.
This moment is important because it creates a strong contrast to Montag’s later development.

[Personal Opinion]
What I think was really interesting, is the relevance that the book still has today. Even though the book was written in the 1950s way before the rise of social media, it already describes a society, that is addicted to shallow media, a society in which reading books is getting less and less important. I enjoyed Montag's journey, kind of waking up and realising the importance of knowledge. 

[Food for thoughts]
Ill wrap things up with some questions that the book made me think about:
- What would happen, if books disappeared today? Would we notice the loss of knowledge?
- How much of what we see on social media controls how we think?
- How different is our world from the distopian world?
